# The Art of Creating Meaningful Interactions

## How do you define a meaningful interaction?

Lets start at the base level: **Interaction** - Very simply defined as communication or direct involvement with someone or something.

From the contact center perspective, we can narrow this down to a customer interacting with a platform, a bot, an agent, or any other media they can consume. For this workshop we'll define an interaction as an engagement between a customer and an agent, afterall, its simple to provide a bot with more answers, but how do we empower our agents?

To many of us consumers, a meaningful interaction can be as simple as those heaps of data we entered into the IVR actually passing through to the agent. Simply put, we entered our account number, and the agent didn't have to ask us for it when we finally connected. They had our account up and the information we entered felt like it had a cause.

But how do we as agents, administrators, supervisors on the other end connect to our customers at a deeper level?

Lets start by putting ourselves in the shoes of the customer. We've had our account for years, we've updated it, we've made changes, we've opened cases and most importantly - **We've interacted with it because it is us**. Why does it feel like every time we interact with someone it's the first time they've ever heard of us? Clearly, I am just an account, I'm just a metric for them that they will report on later.

Next lets set ourselves in the shoes of the provider - For anyone that has worked in a contact center as an agent, we **interact** with many customers every day, and the cause of their complaints are usually transparent to us, or out of our control. We answer a call, sometimes we don't know who's calling, we authenticate them and attempt to fix their issue. The constant complaints of "I've already entered this into your phone system" are lost on us, we didn't build the phone system afterall and we're just here to help. We have many disparate systems and our solution is to add more monitors and tabs to keep track of who we're talking to and when.

The goal of part 1 of this 2 part workshop series is to showcase how we can utilize scripts to provide incredibly powerful tools to the agents with minimal effort - With the appropriate tools and resources, agents can begin to construct meaningful interactions. 

We will walk through a simple data source construction as well as an understanding of the scripting interface to introduce the basic concepts required to make more advanced scripts. We will move into custom script actions to showcase at a intermediate level how to we can use scripts to allow our agents to execute powerful functions.

## Data Table Construction

To begin we will navigate to Admin > Scripts and create a new script. After providing a name you will be presented a list of default script options, for this workshop we will use a **Blank Script**.

Welcome to the blank canvas! While we encourage all forms of artistic design, for this portion of the workshop we will build a script that, while not the most beautiful, demonstrates the simplicity of providing powerful information to the agents.

To begin, it is important to understand the basic concepts of script construction. The basic building blocks of scripts are **Horizontal Containers** and **Vertical Containers**. Simply put, do you want your components to align left to right? or top down?

In the image below, you can see the 2 container types of horizontal and vertical at the top tool bar.

Containers are capable of being nested, meaning you can have containers within containers. At the bottom of the screen you can see what container you're currently interacting with and easily navigate between these containers by clicking on lower or higher level containers.

In the image below, we have a horizontal container with 2 nested horizontal containers stacked side by side.

This allows us to split a single horizontal container into 2 separate containers, and input components such as buttons into separate portions of the screen. Below we can see a button in both of the horizontal containers, creating a visual separation of these components.

There are numerous visual editors we can add to these containers, such as background color or borders (both of which can be found by selecting the container and selecting appearance on the right hand side).

Within layout, we can define visualizations such as **Child Arrangement** (do I want my buttons centered, at the start or at the end of a container?) and **Visibility** (do I only want to show this component based upon other parameters?)

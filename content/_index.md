# The Art of Creating Meaningful Interactions

## How can we use Genesys Cloud Scripting to Empower Agents?

At a high level, the goal of part 1 of this workshop is to showcase how we can provide incredibly powerful tools to our agents. With the appropriate tools and resources, agents can begin to construct meaningful interactions. We will walk through incredibly basic data source construction as well as a very low level understanding of the scripting interface to introduce the basic concepts required to make more advanced scripts. We will move into custom script actions to showcase at an intermediate level how to we can use scripts to execute powerful functions.
